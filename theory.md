### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify;"> Percolation is the ability of soil to absorb water. The amount of water absorbed by any soil at any given time is known as the percolation rate and plays a major role to determine filter field design and site suitability for an on-site wastewater treatment facility. Different soil has different percolation rate as the rate of percolation depends on soil type. For experimental purpose percolation rate is determined by measuring the amount of water passing through the test hole in any given period of time.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify;">Generally Percolation rate is highest in sandy soil and least in clayey soil, which is also an indicative that percolation rate also depends on particle size. The major drawback with the test is that it does not take into account the capillary action.</p>
